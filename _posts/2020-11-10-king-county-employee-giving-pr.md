The Employee Giving Program (EGP) is the workplace giving program for employees of King County government. It was established in 1988 to create an easy and cost-effective way for employees to support their favorite nonprofit organizations, reduce the disruption to the workplace that multiple campaigns caused, and introduce an avenue for different nonprofits to participate. Essentially, EGP exists to make it easy for you to do good.



In 1988, there were fewer than 10 nonprofit organizations participating. Today there are more than 1,000 with more added every year. Over this time, more than $25 million have been donated by King County employees, making this the third largest public sector workplace giving program in the state.
