Vaccines for Children (VFC) was established in 1993 to remove the barriers of cost and access to attaining childhood immunizations. The program is funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the State of Washington, and supplies vaccines to providers across the state.

Most public and private health care providers who immunize children in King County are currently enrolled. All children from birth up to the 19th birthday are eligible to receive these vaccines.
